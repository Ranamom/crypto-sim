# Codeception Test Suite Configuration
#
# Suite for acceptance tests.
# Perform tests in browser using the WebDriver or PhpBrowser.
# If you need both WebDriver and PHPBrowser tests - create a separate suite.
# Tests code by interacting with application through web browser
# TODO - Get the passwords and secret data out of this file

# TODO - To leave the session table alone, create a new database user to use for acceptance testing where it doesn't
# have permission to delete the sessions table, so it fails when it tries, and also make it so that it only recreates
# the sessions table if it doesn't exist (this might be a problem though, since you can't specify that in the dump file)
# Temporarily, it might be easier to just re-add a session to the database after each test
